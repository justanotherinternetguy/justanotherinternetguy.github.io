          <p class="planep">
            The Northrop P-61 Black Widow was the US Army Air Force's first
            <i>night fighter</i>. At the time, combat avionics such as radar
            were large and bulky, forcing aircraft designers to create a
            different class of aircraft to house the avionics. In contrast,
            <i>day fighters</i> were designed to be nimble and light, while
            <i>night fighters</i> were much larger and had complex avionics. The
            rather long nose of the P-61 housed the SCR-720 radar. Generally,
            P-61s would be vectored into a general combat area by ground
            control. Once at the scene of the combat, the P-61 could use its own
            radar to search for enemy aircraft. The P-61 was a generally capable
            aircraft, being able to stand ground against most German bombers and
            any Japanese aircraft at the time. Nearing the end of WW2, the P-61
            began to be outclassed by new German fighters. After the end of WW2,
            the P-61 saw some sporadic use until the US could develop a jet
            interceptor.
            <br />
            Overall, the P-61 spearheaded the implementation and usage of
            complex avionics in aerial combat. While it didn't live up to the
            same fame as other fighters of its time, it still contributed
            meaningfully to the war effort.
