            Perhaps not many know about the R6V - only 2 prototypes were ever
            created and much of the plane has been lost to the annals of time.
            In many ways, the R6V, like most Lockheed planes, were cutting-edge
            and at the very forefront of aeronautical development for its time.
            The Constitution started in 1942 as a joint study between Lockheed,
            the U.S. Navy, and Pan Am. The Navy wanted a new transport aircraft
            to either replace or improve on its aging fleet of flying boats.

            The "double bubble" fuselage, which has the cross-section of a
            "figure-eight," provided the same structural advantages of using a
            cylinder for full-cabin pressurization, but without the wasted space
            that came with a cylinder of similar volume. Such a design was first
            tested on the C-46 Commando, but the R6V was still very innovative
            for its time. The aircraft remains, to this day, the largest
            fixed-wing aircraft ever operated by the U.S. Navy.
