          <section id="intro">
            <p>
              When I was in elementary and middle school, chewing gum was a
              sacred piece of currency traded in a school-wide black market.
              Debts were paid and collected in the form of gum
              <i
                >("I gave you gum last week -- what were the answers to the
                homework?")</i
              >. I'm not innocent when it comes to begging for gum, either -- I
              was usually one of the first to perk up, sensing the magnetic pull
              of a stick of Trident and immediately begging for a piece.
            </p>
            <p>
              My parents rarely had any gum, fearing dental and jaw development
              issues. As a 10-year-old kid, I would beg for a pack of gum every
              time we came to the cash register at ShopRite. Now, no longer a
              10-year-old, I am free to make choices with my own money!
            </p>
            <p>
              And so we come to this blog. I will be recording the taste and
              experience of every single piece of gum I chew starting from Nov.
              15, 2025. I've always found comfort and joy in collecting,
              categorizing, and ranking simple things.
            </p>
            <p>
              The archive will be organized by company/brand, but this taxonomy
              is subject to change when I inevitably think of a better method
              during a long, hot shower.

            <p>Some general notes on my rankings and ratings:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Chew time is measured from the first bite to when I spit out the
                gum. This is a relatively subjective measurement as I have no
                quantitative metric for this. It's usually just when the flavor
                runs out or my jaw gets tired.
              </li>

            <h1>Trident</h1>
            <p>
              Trident gum can be found everywhere across supermarkets and
              retailers large and small.

                      The flavor does have a strong candy taste and is sweet.
                      The main flavor tastes indeed like biting into a large
                      piece of cotton candy. During the first 10-15 minutes of
                      chewing when the flavor is most intense, there is a
                      slightly cooling/minty effect on the tongue. I also taste
                      very slight hints of orange. It is overall pleasant and
                      enjoyable, though the flavor was a little unexpected for
                      me at the start as I very rarely have tried non-fruit or
                      non-mint flavored gums.

                      Refresh is a brand of "plant-based gum," forgoing
                      traditional synthetic gum bases made with plastics and
                      petroleum and instead using chicle, a tree sap. As they

                        href="https://refreshgum.com/pages/learn-more"

                        >their website,
                      </a>
                      they use plant-based flavors, "natural colors" from fruits
                      and vegetables, and "plant-based sweeteners" like xylitol
                      and stevia.
                      <hr />
                      The gum pieces are a little smaller but still substantial,
                      with a good mouthfeel. After chewing and “breaking in” the
                      gum, it becomes noticeably firmer and a little stickier
                      than your typical convenience-store Trident or Orbit.
                      However, unlike its non-plant-based counterparts, Refresh
                      gum maintains the same texture and does not lose any
                      pliability or softness, even after hours of chewing.
                      <hr />
                      The flavor itself is not as strong but lasts much longer.
                      I can still taste a pleasant raspberry note after more
                      than two hours of chewing. There is no mint or cooling
                      sensation at all. When I first started chewing, it had a
                      uniquely slightly salty tinge to it.
                      <hr />
                      Underneath the raspberry flaor, there is a unique woody
                      flavor to it as well.
