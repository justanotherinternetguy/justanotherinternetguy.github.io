          <h1>New favorite application - Zotero</h1>
          <h6>02/27/20252</h6>
          <p>
            As I try to read more literature and papers that I'm interested in,
            <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a> has
            become a LIFESAVER. It does so much more than just store citations -
            it is a polished, efficient, one-stop shop for saving and annotating
            papers as you read.
          </p>
          <h2>Super Cool Features</h2>
          <p>
            The most useful feature about Zotero is its browser extension. The
            <i>Zotero Connector</i> allows you to automatically save and cite
            any paper from just a click of a button. In fact, it doesn't even
            have to be a research paper - Zotero handles saving websites and
            other forms of text-based media. It automatically handles citations
            and Zotero citations have been extremely accurate - I rarely ever
            have to go back in and manually add/correct its citations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exporting citations is simple, too. You can select an entry (or
            multiple entries) and export them as a text-based bibliography,
            in-text citations, or as a BibTex file. There are a myriad of
            configuration options to make sure the formatting and style of the
            exported citations are correct - This has been super useful for my
            large research projects which require several citations to manage
            and juggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also appreciate Zotero's built-in article reader. It allows me to
            highlight, annotate, and draw on the article directly to take notes.
            This has been extremely helpful in quickly highlighting useful
            information for me to revisit and learn later.
