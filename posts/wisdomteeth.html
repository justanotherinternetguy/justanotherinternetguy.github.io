              I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed today under full
              sedation. This will be a blog post about my experiences. I hope
              that for those reading, it will clear up some confusion and
              anxiety about the operation. I will do my best to document the
              operation with as much detail as possible.

            <h1>T-1 Day</h1>
            <p>
              The day before the surgery, I was instructed not to eat any food
              after 10pm. I had a larger dinner than usual at around 6pm because
              I would not be able to eat or drink the morning of the surgery.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>8:40</h1>
            <p>
              I woke up around this time to have time to get ready and arrive
              early at the dentist's office. Following my dentist's orders, I
              just brushed my teeth and did not drink or eat anything. I arrived
              at the dentist's office at 9:20.
            </p>
          </section>

            <h1>9:20</h1>
            <p>
              When we arrived at the dentist's office, my mother and I signed
              some consent forms and I was escorted to the surgery room at
              around 9:30.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>9:30</h1>
            <p>
              A nurse confirmed with me the address of my local pharmacy for OTC
              medication and hooked me up to some sort of vitals monitor with 3
              electrodes (1 on right wrist, 1 on left wrist, 1 on left forearm),
              1 sphygmomanometer (blood pressure monitor), and a blood oxygen
              monitor that clipped onto my finger.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>9:45</h1>
            <p>
              The same nurse gave me a gas mask and some laughing gas to calm me
              down and, quote, "for a bit of fun." This was honestly very
              comforting for me as it showed they really did care about my
              wellbeing and mental state during the entire procedure as well.
              The laughing gas was administered through a mask around my nose
              that pumped a stream of gas into my right nostril.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few minutes, I began to feel the effects. I felt a little
              drowsy and my fingertips and feet began to tingle pleasantly. When
              I moved my fingers, I felt small but pleasant pulsing up my hand
              and into my wrist.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>10:00</h1>
            <p>
              The doctor came in and connected me to the IV for full sedation. I
              have had a fully sedated surgery before, but I was so young I
              don't remember much.
            </p>
            <p>
              The onset of sedation was an incredibly weird feeling. Almost
              instantly, my limbs felt heavy and weak. For around 10-15 seconds,
              I was still awake and cognizant. Then, my vision began to
              constrict and go dark. That is the last thing I remember.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>10:40</h1>
            <p>I woke up. Here are the first things I noticed:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I could not move or feel my mouth</li>
              <li>Extreme dizziness and complete disorientation</li>
              <li>Inability to move my legs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I believe the inability to move my mouth was because of the
              overwhelming numbness that the sedation caused and the gauze that
              was placed on the sides to help stop the bleeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm pretty sure I was given a local anesthetic/numbing agent on
              top of the general sedation as my bottom lip continued to be numb
              for hours after the surgery while the rest of my face was fine.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>Medications</h1>
            <p>
              At this point, I was given a bag with several medications with
              instructions. My (very thoughtful) nurse made me record her verbal
              instructions on my phone so I could refer to them later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is a list of all the medications I was prescribed and their
              general function according to my nurse:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Amoxicillin 500 mg tablets: </strong> General
                antibiotic, taken 3 times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dexamethasone 4 mg tablets: </strong> Steroid, reduces
                swelling. I was given only 4 pills, instructed to take one in
                the morning and one at night.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Chlorhexidine 0.12% mouth rinse: </strong>Used in the
                morning/at night for 1 week, helps promote tissue healing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ibuprofen 600 mg tablets: </strong>Prescription-strength
                ibuprofen to be taken every 6 hours for the next 72 hours. Used
                as an anti-inflammatory.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Extra-strength Tylenol: </strong>This was to be taken in
                between the 6-hour doses of Ibuprofen, so every 3 hours I was
                getting some sort of pain management. However, the pain was not
                that bad for me and I actually did not need the Tylenol at all.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Norco 5/325 mg: </strong>5 mg of the opioid hydrocodone
                bitartrate and 325 mg of acetaminophen. This was a
                <strong>handwritten prescription</strong> for a much stronger
                narcotic for <strong>breakthrough pain</strong> that cannot be
                managed by the Ibuprofen and Tylenol.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other notes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                After eating, rinse mouth with warm salt water to get rid of
                residual food.
              </li>
              <li>
                I can still brush my teeth but should be careful to avoid
                disturbing the wounded area.
              </li>
              <li>
                I was to avoid drinking from straws or any food that required
                sucking (e.g., noodles), as this could disturb the formation of
                the blood clot.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rice, popcorn, seedy fruits</strong>, and anything else
                with small particles were to be avoided since small seeds may
                get stuck in the wound.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>11:00</h1>
            <p>
              After getting home, I was still a little disoriented. As it was
              around lunchtime, I took my lunch dose of 1 Amoxicillin and 1
              Ibuprofen to start the 6-hour cycles. I left the dentist's office
              with gauze in my mouth, so I changed out the now-bloodied gauze
              with new gauze that was given to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't really have an appetite but I still wanted to get
              something down, so I had some applesauce and yogurt.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>13:00 to 18:30</h1>
            <p>
              I slept for this entire time, only waking up twice (once at 14:30
              and once around 16:30). The pain peaked at around 14:30, where it
              felt like someone was chiseling into my jaw. I could feel the pain
              at the base/roots of my teeth. I really didn't want to take more
              painkillers than I had to, so I just laid there for a while and
              tried to fall back asleep.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>18:45</h1>
            <p>
              I woke up to eat dinner. At this point, a blood clot had formed
              and my saliva was still tinged red, but I don't think the wound
              was actively bleeding anymore. I still had no appetite and could
              taste blood, so I had porridge and some pork that had been
              overcooked to shreds. I was really only able to chew with my front
              teeth (incisors), so I didn't eat anything that required a lot of
              grinding or tearing with the molars.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>Around 19:20</h1>
            <p>
              At this point, I have stabilized/relaxed enough where I can
              provide some more detail on my condition. Here are a few more
              observations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I am unable to open my mouth fully. Even opening it halfway puts
                pressure and causes a small spike in pain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Moving my jaw side-to-side is uncomfortable and can also cause
                pain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Swallowing is uncomfortable in general and the back of my mouth
                is sore.
              </li>
              <li>
                My lower cheeks are a little swollen and very warm to the touch.
              </li>
            </ul>
